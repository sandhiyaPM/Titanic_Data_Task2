## Titanic Dataset Analysis â€“ EDA Project
This notebook presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, aimed at discovering key factors that influenced passenger survival. The main steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling null values and converting data types where needed.

Visual Exploration: Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate insightful visualizations like heatmaps, pairplots, and countplots.

Feature Insights: Examining relationships between survival and features such as Age, Fare, Sex, and Pclass.

Outlier Analysis: Detecting unusual data points through visual tools like boxplots.
